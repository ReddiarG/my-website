## Overview

In this project, I developed predictive models to identify patients at risk of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) — a silent, progressive condition with major public health impact. Using a clinical dataset of 1,659 patients (from Kaggle), I tackled the significant class imbalance (1,524 CKD cases vs 135 non-CKD) using SMOTE oversampling and class weighting strategies to enhance model fairness.

## Method & Results

implemented and evaluated three models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost — comparing them across both 80/20 and 50/50 train-test splits. Key metrics included AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and balanced accuracy:

- **Random Forest** consistently achieved the highest sensitivity (up to 99.67%), making it ideal for clinical screening where missing a positive case could be critical.
- **XGBoost** offered the best balance of performance, with the highest AUC (0.856) and balanced accuracy (66.64%) in the 80/20 split.
- **Logistic Regression**, while highly interpretable, showed slightly lower sensitivity and specificity compared to ensemble methods.

## Key Insights

The most predictive features — like serum creatinine, glomerular filtration rate, and urinary protein — aligned with known clinical indicators. Despite model tuning, specificity remained a challenge due to the dataset imbalance, revealing opportunities for future work in cost-sensitive learning and dataset expansion.
